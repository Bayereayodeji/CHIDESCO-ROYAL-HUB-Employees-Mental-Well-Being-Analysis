remote work and its impact on employee mental well-being analysis

In light of the ongoing shift to remote work, it has become imperative to assess its impact on employee mental well-being. This analysis, conducted as part of my Data Analytics learning journey at Vephla University, explores how remote, hybrid, and onsite work settings affect stress levels, work-life balance, job satisfaction, and mental health conditions across industries and regions. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, comprises 5,000 records from employees worldwide, providing a detailed examination of the challenges and opportunities in managing mental health in the workplace.
